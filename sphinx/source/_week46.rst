Week 46 - Introduction to AI, Data Science & Machine Learning
=============================================================

Today and the next 3 weeks, we will work within the topic of "AI, Data Science and Machine Learning". 

We start out using the helicopter view and look at what AI are, and what Machine learning and Data Science´s role is in connection with this. 

The next 2 weeks we will work in more details with first Data Science and then Machine Learning.

You will need to read a bit more than up until now this semester, and it will also be a bit more mathematical and algorithmic than until now.

But see it as an inspiration and an overview into the field of Data Science and Machine learning, and especially an introduction to the various tools needed for working within this erea.
