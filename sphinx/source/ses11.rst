Session 11 - Context Managers 
=============================

Today we will work with **Context Managers**. 

Context managers can in short be described as something that takes care of the related tasks of a specific task. An example of this could be when opening a file, the context manager takes care of automaticly closing the file when we are finished using it. 

You will make your own context managers and use already created ones.
